      <description>In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;m going to share how could be build WebRTC chat with React.js. Before we continue lets describe briefly what React.js and WebRTC are.
The application from this tutorial is available at GitHub.
React.js React.js is reactive JavaScript framework, which helps you to build user interface. Facebook states that we can think of React as the &amp;ldquo;V&amp;rdquo; in MVC. React&amp;rsquo;s main aspect is the state. When the state of the application changes this automatically propagates through the application&amp;rsquo;s components.</description>

      <title>Singleton in JavaScript</title>

      <description>Wikipedia describes the singleton design pattern as:
 The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.</description>

      <title>The magic of $resource (or simply a client-side Active Record)</title>

      <description>At first sight AngularJS seems like a magical framework, which does some weird but awesome things like dependency injection, data binding only by setting a single property to the magical object named $scope and many other things.
If you look at the source code of Angular you&amp;#8217;ll see a lot of smart and simple solutions for these magical problems. In this blog post I&amp;#8217;ll describe the magic which stays behind $resource.</description>

      <description>Today I created a GitHub repository which contains a set of good practices and style guides for AngularJS application development.
Its main goal is to be community-driven and to concentrate all the best practices for AngularJS development in one place.
I&amp;#8217;ve collected these guidelines mostly from my own experience and the source code of AngularJS. I guess there are missing things thats why I&amp;#8217;ll try to fill the gaps in future.</description>

      <description>This blog post is concentrated about web performance. I&amp;#8217;ll skip the well known stuff about combining images into sprites, inlining images, DNS pre-fetching, combining and minifying script files, gzipping and so on. There are plenty of articles and tools which will help you about these things. There are also excellent researches on these topics, few of the best I&amp;#8217;ve read are these by Mobify, Web Performance Daybook Volume, High Performance Web Sites and Critical rendering path &amp;#8211; Crash course on web performance and many others.</description>

      <title>VNC client on 200 lines of JavaScript</title>

      <description>In this quick blog post I&amp;#8217;ll show you how to create a simple VNC client in about 200 lines of JavaScript. For our goal we&amp;#8217;re going to use only HTML5 and JavaScript (client and server side). The end result will be something like this:

So, let&amp;#8217;s begin!
Our application will have very simple architecture &amp;#8211; a proxy server written in Node.js and a client in HTML5 and JavaScript. The Node.</description>

      <title>Aspect-Oriented Programming with AngularJS</title>

      <description>In the following blog post I&amp;#8217;ll write few words about what is Aspect-Oriented Programming, why I think it will be useful in AngularJS and I&amp;#8217;m also going to give you a short tutorial for using a simple AOP framework I&amp;#8217;ve developed.
First things first. What is AOP? As we all know OOP is awesome! It gives us many tools for making our development process simpler. Its core principles are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.</description>

      <title>CSS3 flipping effect</title>

      <description>As you know because of the SIMD nature of the GPU it&amp;#8217;s extremely good for graphical calculations. Since HTML5 and CSS3 are here we have a couple of ways for efficient and smooth animations one of them are the CSS3 transitions.
Before few days I needed a CSS3 flipping effect which should works at least in IE10, Chrome 25+ and Firefox. I tried different demos which I found in the web but there were couple of issues with them.</description>

      <description>plainvm can take the virtualization into different level of usage. To prove this I&amp;#8217;ll first ask few rhetorical questions and put their answers&amp;#8230;Which is the programming language which everyone has interpreter for? Java? Actually no! Does iOS supports Java applets for example?! No! Everyone has a browser in his smartphone. Every browser (well may be I should exclude lynx, links&amp;#8230;) has JavaScript interpreter. And what is the common thing between all modern devices (and actually the devices most wide spread) &amp;#8211; the browser.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I&amp;#8217;ve created a GitHub repository. It&amp;#8217;s main goal was to collect different algorithms with implementations in JavaScript. I started with basic ones &amp;#8211; sorting (insertion, selection, bubble sort..). After that I implemented few &amp;#8220;more advance&amp;#8221; like marge, quick and heap sort. It was interesting to me how much slower my implementation will be compared to the default sort. It was so interesting because of:
function sort() { [native code] }  That&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve wrote not optimized version of mergesort and I&amp;#8217;ve run it with generated array with 500k elements.</description>

      <description>And one more blog post by me! It&amp;#8217;s going to be in brand new topic than the others. For about an year and a half I&amp;#8217;ve got an idea which I wanted to accomplish&amp;#8230;To create my own simple programming language. Actually it&amp;#8217;s very useful task and quite interesting. Creating it you can get better understanding how the compilers and interpreters work and probably write better code. Unfortunately there were two problems&amp;#8230;I didn&amp;#8217;t have enough time for such task and&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;ve not studied formal grammars (and as I mentioned I don&amp;#8217;t have enough time to study them&amp;#8230;there are just so much more interesting things to read about :-P ).</description>

      <title>HTML5 image editor</title>

      <description>As you see HTML5 is everywhere (of course I exclude IE&amp;#8230;or just before version 10). Web site used for quick image composition or edition is something very useful for the &amp;#8220;modern web person&amp;#8221;. There are few such services. Most of them use Flash. Nothing against it but&amp;#8230;it&amp;#8217;s too heavy for me&amp;#8230;unnecessarily heavy. For all that stuff you can use HTML5 canvas. I also found some HTML5 image editors but their functionality was very limited.</description>

      <description>Few days ago I was creating a system in which it was necessary to implement a sound notification feature. Well it&amp;#8217;s not very hard task but of course you have to be careful with the browser compatibility. At first my source was something like that:
playSound: function () { this.config.soundNotify.html(&amp;#39;&amp;lt;embed src=&amp;quot;&amp;#39; + this.config.soundFile + &amp;#39;.wav&amp;quot; hidden=true autostart=true loop=false&amp;gt;&amp;#39;); }  Actually in my Linux it was working pretty well (I tried it mainly in Chrome).</description>
