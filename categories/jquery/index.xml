      <description>This article is about the functional concepts of JavaScript. Some of them are built-in the languages, others extra implemented but all of them are very common for purely functional languages like Haskell. First I want to tell what I mean with the term purely functional language. These languages are &amp;#8220;safe&amp;#8221;, they will not make side effect i.e. evaluating an expression won&amp;#8217;t change something in the internal state and lead to different result of the same expression when called next time.</description>

      <description>And one post in English&amp;#8230;For few days I&amp;#8217;m developing one jQuery UI plugin. It&amp;#8217;s picture gallery which I&amp;#8217;ve seen in flash but not in JavaScript, that&amp;#8217;s why I decided to fix this. The gallery is a set of rotating pictures and difference ways of handling the perspective. There&amp;#8217;s nothing complicated in it just little analytic geometry. I haven&amp;#8217;t used any canvases or SVG because I&amp;#8217;ve wanted the biggest possible browser compatibility.</description>

      <description>Hi! I haven&amp;#8217;t wrote since a long time but there&amp;#8217;s so much code and so little time&amp;#8230;It&amp;#8217;s bad that the biggest part of the code is not open source but what can we do&amp;#8230;Last few hours I developed a JavaScript plugin for color animation. Of course for few hours I cant make something with great quality so it&amp;#8217;s a little bit unstable (I think) but it works and it&amp;#8217;s also valid for the JSLint standards.</description>
