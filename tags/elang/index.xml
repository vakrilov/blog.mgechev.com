      <description>And one more blog post by me! It&amp;#8217;s going to be in brand new topic than the others. For about an year and a half I&amp;#8217;ve got an idea which I wanted to accomplish&amp;#8230;To create my own simple programming language. Actually it&amp;#8217;s very useful task and quite interesting. Creating it you can get better understanding how the compilers and interpreters work and probably write better code. Unfortunately there were two problems&amp;#8230;I didn&amp;#8217;t have enough time for such task and&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;ve not studied formalÂ grammars (and as I mentioned I don&amp;#8217;t have enough time to study them&amp;#8230;there are just so much more interesting things to read about :-P ).</description>
